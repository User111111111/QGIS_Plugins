# QGIS_Plugins
# This plugin allows you to create ellipses in QGIS based on minor and major axis diameter widths and a rotation angle, adding additional functionality to that found in previous plugins that only allowed freehand/non-dimensioned drawing of ellipses. The tool can be used for example to map wind turbine separation distances.
#The tool will draw the ellipse in the centre of your current QGIS map window, to then be moved as you wish.
